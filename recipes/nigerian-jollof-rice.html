        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Nigerian Jollof Rice</strong> is a classic West African dish that's a staple in most households. It's a spicy and savory dish made with rice, tomatoes, tomato paste, onions, red bell pepper, and a variety of seasonings. The dish is known for its delicious, smoky flavor and simplicity, and it's a favorite in Nigeria and beyond</p>
        <p><em>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make it:</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Long-grain rice</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Red bell pepper</li>
            <li>Scotch bonnet peppers</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Spices (Nigerian-style curry powder and dried thyme)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oli</li>
            <li>Chicken stock</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Ingredients: Wash the peppers, onion, and tomatoes. Blend the chopped ingredients together</li>
            <li>Heat the Oil: Heat the vegetable oil over medium heat in a large pot</li>
            <li>Cook the Onions: Chop 1 onion and sauté it in the oil for 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Cook the Tomato Paste: Scoop 2 tbsp (30 ml) of tomato paste and add it to the pot. Mix the tomato paste with the onions over medium heat. Frequently stir the ingredients until the mixture takes on a grainy, sandy appearance, which typically takes around 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add the Rice and Seasonings: Add the rice, chicken stock, water, and salt. Cover and cook the rice for 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Simmer the Rice: Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir the rice after 20 minutes. Simmer the rice for an additional 10-20 minutes. If you don’t have a well-fitting lid, cover the pot with tin foil. Trapping the steam and cooking the rice over low ensures it has a soft, tender texture</li>
            <li>Serve the Jollof Rice: Fluff and stir the jollof rice with a fork and then serve. Nigerian jollof rice is great to eat on its own, or pair it with fried chicken or beef, or whip up a delicious coleslaw or salad</li>
            <li>Remember, you can make Nigerian Jollof as spicy or flavorful as you want it. Feel free to add more scotch bonnet peppers, curry powder, bay leaves, or any of the other spices to get the rice to your liking</li>
        </ol>
